## ⚙ Tech Stack

## Backend:

Python, FastAPI

MySQL, PyMySQL

Pandas for in-memory calculations
## Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Node.js, Express

## 🗄 Data Storage Architecture

Database Schema Structure: See schemas.sql in the backend folder.

Why PyMySQL + MySQL Works:

Relational design supports joins, indexes, and constraints.

JSON fields can store structured calculation details.

PyMySQL allows batch inserts and transactions with conn.commit() and cursor.execute().

## Indexing Strategies:

Index on employee_id, sale_date, role, and vehicle_type.

Partition historical calculation tables by month/year for 24M+ rows.

## 📜 Rule Engine Design
## 1️⃣ Managing 500+ Rules Efficiently

Store structured rules and ad-hoc rules in separate tables (structured_rules, ad_hoc_rules).

Include:

Role, vehicle type, min/max units, bonus, validity dates.

upload_file_id for traceability and rule_version for versioning.

Pre-load all rules into memory using pandas DataFrames for bulk calculations.

Use indexes on frequently queried columns: role, vehicle_type, valid_from, valid_to.

## 2️⃣ Rule Versioning

Use rule_version or valid_from/valid_to to store historical rules.

Query rules valid for the target period:

SELECT * FROM structured_rules
WHERE valid_from <= %s AND valid_to >= %s


Keep old rules for historical calculations.

## 3️⃣ Resolving Conflicting Rules

Add a priority column → higher priority overrides lower.

Most specific rule wins (exact match on vehicle/role).

Optionally, sum all applicable rules if cumulative bonuses are allowed.

Log all applied rules per sale in JSON for auditing.

## 4️⃣ Rules Engine Implementation
Option	Pros	Cons	Recommendation
Drools / Commercial engine	Handles complex rules, conflicts, versioning	Java-based, not Python-native	Not needed unless rules are extremely complex
Custom Python	Fully controllable, integrates with FastAPI + pandas	Must handle conflicts and versioning carefully	Recommended: Current pandas + PyMySQL approach
🧮 Calculation Performance
1️⃣ Naive Algorithm Problem

Looping through each employee × each rule → O(n × m).

Example: 1M employees × 500 rules = 500M iterations → slow.

## 2️⃣ Performance Optimization Strategies

## a) Pre-computation:

Aggregate sales per employee, role, vehicle type before applying rules:

df_sales_agg = df_sales.groupby(['employee_id', 'role', 'vehicle_type']) \
                       .agg({'quantity': 'sum'}).reset_index()


## b) Caching:

Cache rules in memory (pandas DataFrame or Python dict).

Use Redis if cross-process caching is needed.

## c) Parallel Processing:

Split employees into batches and process in parallel using multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.

Example: 1M employees → 10 parallel workers → 10× speedup.

## d) Vectorized Calculations:

Use pandas merges and vectorized operations instead of row-by-row loops:

df_rules_applied = pd.merge(df_sales_agg, df_rules, 
                            on=['role', 'vehicle_type'])
df_rules_applied = df_rules_applied[
    (df_rules_applied['quantity'] >= df_rules_applied['min_units']) &
    (df_rules_applied['quantity'] <= df_rules_applied['max_units'])
]
df_rules_applied['structured_amount'] = df_rules_applied['incentive_amount_inr'] + \
                                        (df_rules_applied['quantity'] - df_rules_applied['min_units']).clip(lower=0) * \
                                        df_rules_applied['bonus_per_unit_inr']


## e) Incremental Calculations:

Only process new or updated sales since the last calculation:

Add calculated_flag column in sales_transactions.

Query only where calculated_flag = 0 or sale_date > last_calc_date.

## 📄 Text Parsing at Scale

Problem: Manual PDF parsing is slow and error-prone.

Solutions:

OCR (Tesseract / AWS Textract / Google Vision) → convert PDFs/images to text.

## NLP / ML Pipelines:

Regex, NER, or ML models to extract schemes, roles, bonuses, and conditions.

Template-Based Parsing:

Works if PDFs have standard layouts; more accurate than OCR + NLP.

## Validation:

Auto-check numeric fields, date ranges, and role/vehicle consistency.

Human-in-the-loop validation for low-confidence extractions.

Keep original PDF for auditing.

## ⏱ Real-Time vs Batch Processing

Monthly batch: Simpler, deterministic, easy to audit.

Real-time calculation: Optional for dashboards or top-performer alerts; complex for full payroll.

Streaming (Kafka): Can update metrics in near real-time while batch handles payroll.

Recommendation: Monthly batch + optional real-time KPI dashboard.

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy

Row-level security (add group_id or branch_id) for multiple dealerships → cost-efficient.

Separate DB instances for high-value clients.

Ensure all queries are filtered by tenant to avoid data leaks.

## ❓ Handling Uncertainty in Rules

Extract structured rules using NLP/ML.

Assign confidence scores; low-confidence rules need human validation.

Ambiguous rules → mark as "manual review required".

Store original text + parsed rule for auditing and dispute resolution.

## 📊 Auditability & Compliance

Store full calculation logs per employee (sales, rules applied, totals).

Provide detailed breakdown reports for HR/finance.

Retain audit logs for 3–5 years; keep original PDFs.

Mask/encrypt PII; enforce access control (GDPR-compliant).

## 🧮 Incentive Calculation Logic

## Step 1: Fetch total sales per employee & vehicle type for the month:

SELECT employee_id, vehicle_type, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales_transactions
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-09-30'
GROUP BY employee_id, vehicle_type;


## Step 2: Apply Structured Rules:

Structured Amount = Base Amount + (Units Sold - Min Units) × Bonus Per Unit


Example:

Compact (12 units) → ₹10,000 + (12-10)*750 = ₹11,500

Mid-Size (10 units) → ₹12,000 + (10-8)*900 = ₹13,800

SUV (8 units) → ₹15,000 + 0*1,300 = ₹15,000

Commercial (15 units) → ₹5,000 + (15-10)*400 = ₹7,000

Structured Total: ₹47,300

## Step 3: Apply Ad-Hoc Rules:

Branch Target Achievement → ₹10,000

Consistency Reward → ₹4,000

Ad-Hoc Subtotal: ₹14,000

## Step 4: Total Incentive: ₹61,300

## Step 5: Store calculation in incentive_calculations table with breakdown JSON.
